- Planet meshes + moons should appear when zoomed into planet
- Create UX for navigation?

- Allow orbits that tilt on the y-axis
- Load in and cache more high-res textures as they're needed, unload when not
- Fancy light for sun

- Collision detection for when zooming around
- Need better camera swinging controls
