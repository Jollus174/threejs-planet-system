- Planet meshes + moons should appear when zoomed into planet
- Create UX for navigation?

- Allow orbits that tilt on the y-axis
- Load in and cache more high-res textures as they're needed, unload when not
- Fancy light for sun
- Fix up planet textures, so are still pinched at top/bottom (like Mercury)
- Include grid helper?

- Uranus orbits to be top to bottom!

- Rework the API data and fill in missing gaps, find/create some sort of scraper

For UX/UI:
- Include 'X Planet' system when arriving at planet
- For Jupiter / Saturn / Uranus / Neptune with a lot of moons, have toggle switcher o---o---o for inner/outer/minor moons
- Include list of available moons to switch to via swiper at bottom (hopefully isn't laggy)

- Include time slider

- Collision detection for when zooming around
- Need better camera swinging controls
